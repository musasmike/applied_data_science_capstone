## Executive Summary
SpaceY, an emerging rocket launch company, founded by billionaire industrialist Allon Musk, is positioning itself to compete with industry giant SpaceX. This project's core objective is two-fold: firstly, to ascertain the optimal launch pricing strategy, and secondly, to forecast the likelihood of SpaceX reusing its initial launch stage based on historical data gleaned from past SpaceX rocket launches.

Our analysis draws from a dataset encompassing 90 SpaceX project launches, each characterized by 18 pertinent features such as Booster Landing, Version Booster, Customer, Orbit, Payload Mass, and more. Among these, three pivotal features merit particular attention: "Flight Number," denoting launch sequence; "Launch Site," indicating the rocket's liftoff location; and "Orbit," signifying the targeted orbital destination. The dataset, sourced from the SpaceX API and web, underwent meticulous cleansing, including filtration to exclusively incorporate Falcon 9 data. Although a segment of the Landing Pad data exhibited a 28.89% deficiency, this omission remained inconsequential for our analytical pursuit.

Our exploratory data analysis employed an array of visualization techniques and SQL commands, expounding the data's essence. Scatter plots and bar charts facilitated comprehension of the distribution of classes—0 indicating unsuccessful landings and 1 symbolizing successful landing. Notably, 66.67% of launches achieved triumphant landings. Remarkably divergent success rates emerged across different launch sites. Particularly for the CCAFS SLC 40 launch site, an escalation in successful landings paralleled mounting flight volumes, signifying an analogous trend for all launch sites. A discernible decline in failed landings further underscored this pattern. Prior to modeling endeavors, data underwent standardization and partitioning into training and testing subsets. 
Employing a quartet of models—logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor—we explored a spectrum of prediction accuracies. Leveraging GridSearchCV for optimal hyperparameter selection, we conducted 10-fold cross-validation across all models. Remarkably, all models exhibited identical accuracy at 0.83, coupled with an f1-score of 0.89 when tested on the testing dataset. This uniformity in high-performance outcomes empowers the selection of any of the models for effective predictions regarding landing project success. Notably, the decision tree model garners distinction, with the best accuracy achieved through hyperparameter tuning.
